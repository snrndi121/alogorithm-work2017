# EXPLAIN THE HOMEWORK
- There are positive integer group. The number range of input paramerter is 5 <= the number <= 100000.And its number is 1<= x <= 1000.
- Then, this is the equation.
- x^2 + y^2 = z

- Find the number z satified this equation in this integer Group. 

- square.inp : first line means the number of the parameter. And the seoncd line arranges the array of the integer.
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

- square.out : You have to print the 'z' of this problem, and sort by ascending. But if there no answer, you print '0'

## Example ##
#( Right case )
square.inp : 
5
3 4 25 100 10016

square.out :
25 10016

#( 0 case )
squre.inp
5
1 2 3 4 5

square.out
0
